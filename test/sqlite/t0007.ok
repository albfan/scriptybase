               scriptybase cannot help you this time.
               
               Try to generate a clone BD, to extract the differences from actual 
                  database to supposed database from scripts

               Many times there's no changes or are really naive so all you have to
                  do is patch sql file or force update in scriptybase changelog table
 See real file applied was
